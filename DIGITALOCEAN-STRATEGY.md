# DigitalOcean Deployment Strategy

## Current Situation:
- ‚úÖ Minimal Docker image built (52.8MB)
- ‚úÖ Garbage collection completed (freed 22.47MB)
- ‚ùå Still hitting quota on Starter tier (524MB limit)
- üìã Registry appears empty but quota still exceeded

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Upgrade to Basic Tier ($5/month) - RECOMMENDED
1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing
2. Upgrade Container Registry to "Basic" tier
3. Get 5.37GB storage (plenty for your needs)
4. Push your minimal image
5. Deploy to App Platform

### Option 2: Alternative DigitalOcean Architecture
Deploy your app to DigitalOcean App Platform directly from GitHub:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Use App Platform's GitHub integration
3. Store media files in DigitalOcean Spaces ($5/month for 250GB)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Use the minimal Docker image approach
2. Store optimized media files in DigitalOcean Spaces
3. Serve media via CDN for better performance

## Immediate Next Steps:

### For Registry Upgrade:
```bash
# After upgrading to Basic tier:
docker push registry.digitalocean.com/apex-workout/wedding-honeymoon-minimal:latest

# Then deploy via web interface:
# https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
```

### For GitHub Integration:
```bash
# Push your current work:
git add .
git commit -m "Minimal Docker setup ready"
git push origin master

# Then use App Platform GitHub integration
```

## Cost Comparison:
- Registry Basic + App Platform: $5 + $5 = $10/month
- GitHub + Spaces + App Platform: $0 + $5 + $5 = $10/month
- Netlify/Vercel: $0/month (but limited features)

Which approach would you prefer?
